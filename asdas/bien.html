        A hot dog (or hotdog) is a grilled or steamed sausage served in the slit of a partially sliced bun. 
        The sausage used is traditionally made from cured pork, beef, or a combination of the two, but 
        alternatives such as chicken, turkey, and vegetarian options are also popular. 
        Hot dogs are commonly garnished with mustard, ketchup, onions, mayonnaise, relish, sauerkraut, 
        and cheese.</i></ins></b></mark>
